# HW 5 Best in Show

The goal of this homework is to practice higher-order functions on a dataset containg data on dogs. You will write functions that use some of the higher-order functions we learned about such as map, filter, and reduce to answer specific questions about dogs as well as write a function of your own that answers a question of your own. You are restricted to only using higher-order functions and may not use loops of any kind.

## The Data

The [dog data](dogs.csv) is in CSV format and contains the following header columns:

- **breed**:
- **akc_group**:
- **datadog_score**:
- **popularity_in_usa**:
- **lifetime_cost**:
- **easiest_to_train**:
- **longevity**:
- **genetic_ailments**:
- **purchase_price**:
- **food_cost**:
- **grooming_required**:
- **suitability_children**:
- **popularity_rating**:
- **size**:

## Instructions

Download the [starter code](lab8-starter.zip) to your computer. Unzip the starter zip file to reveal the `main.py` file. You can use any code editor you wish to follow along with the instructor.

The instructor will walk through solving the various programming challenges in this lab. Your job is to listen and understand the code the instructor presents and copy that code into your own solution file.

Make sure you ask questions during the lab to clarify any confusion you might have.

At the end of the lab, you will have the complete solution in your solution file.
