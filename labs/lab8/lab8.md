# Lab 8 Olympic Medals

The goal of this lab is to practice several concepts and programming skill with a particular emphasis on functions. The lab introduces the concept of retrieving data in CSV format from a remote computer over the web and writing several functions that process that data in various ways. It combines our understanding of data types and their use within functions to accomplish a task. This lab also covers how to install a 3rd-party library using the `pip` package management tool.

## Practice Topics

This lab practices the following:

- Function definitions
- Function calls
- Lambda statement
- Higher-order functions
- List data type: `append` method, indexing
- Set data type: `add` method
- Dict data type: indexing
- For loops
- If statement
- `zip` function
- `len` function
- `max` function
- `set` function
- `request` module
- `csv` module
- `pip` package management tool

## Instructions

Download the [starter code](lab8-starter.zip) to your computer. Unzip the starter zip file to reveal the `main.py` file. You can use any code editor you wish to follow along with the instructor.

The instructor will walk through solving the various programming challenges in this lab. Your job is to listen and understand the code the instructor presents and copy that code into your own solution file.

Make sure you ask questions during the lab to clarify any confusion you might have.

At the end of the lab, you will have the complete solution in your solution file.

## Submission
